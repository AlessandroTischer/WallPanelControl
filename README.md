## Compatible devices

The app was developed with a closed source java library sent by the store I bought the tablet from. I know for sure this library works on many models, but I cannot guarantee it will work on yours.

The tablet I'm using is [this](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/9-7-Inch-Android-Intelligent-Central_1601238011512.html?spm=a2700.shop_plgr.41413.23.72e57121hUKIkI), which is often called SMT97. You can send me other model numbers once you checked are working creating a post [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/support-for-leds-on-meeting-room-tablets/804178/5), and I'll add them as supported.
